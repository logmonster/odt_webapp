  Shop Listing Page
</h1>

<div class='sf-parargraph'>
  In this section, we will cover the following topics:
  <ul class="sf-list">
    <li>the introduction of the areas / components of the shop listing page</li>
    <li>the query result based on the searchbar's text and facets chosen values
      (e.g. category name or brand name)</li>
    <li>basic <mark>pagination</mark> approach</li>
  </ul>

  <div class='sf-chapter-sub-label'>the Shop Listing page</div>
  <div class='sf-paragraph-sub text-justify' style="overflow: auto;">
    <img src='/image/spy/landingListSpy01.png'
      style='width: 400px; float: left; margin-right: 4px; border: 1px solid #ddd;' />
    There isn't much new things on the listing page, we still have the good old
    <mark>searchbar</mark> component, the <mark>facets</mark> on the left. The
    new things are the listing page component in which we get back a list of
    documents based on the value of the <mark>searchbar</mark> and the filters
    chosen from the <mark>Facets</mark>. On the top of the listing component,
    the chosen filters are listed; you can toggle the filter by pressing it.
    The center part of the component are the documents considered to be a hit
    based on our criteria, each document is shown in a preview mode, feel free
    to press the image of the target product and you would be forwarded to the
    product details page. Finally the lower part of the component are 2 buttons
    for pagination purpose. (in real world, you might want to create pagination
    controls just like any search engine does. As this course focuses on how to
    integrate <mark>Elasticsearch</mark> with the view technology stack, all
    the components involved are coded as simple as possible
    <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>)
  </div>

  <div class='sf-chapter-sub-label'>the Query and the Facets filters</div>
  <div class='sf-paragraph-sub text-justify' >
    There are typically 2 ways to trigger a search for the listing. One of the ways
    is to type in something in the <mark>searchbar</mark> component and press
    the "search" (magnifying glass) button. The 2nd way is to chosen an option
    on either <mark>Facets</mark> component (category or brand). Let's assume
    we have the most complicated scenario; keyed in <var>"cake"</var> as the
    <mark>searchbar</mark>'s text, picked <var>"food"</var> from the category
    <mark>Facets</mark> and picked <var>"avery works"</var> from the brands
    <mark>Facets</mark>. The query would be the following:
  </div>

  <div class='sf-paragraph-sub text-justify' >
    <div>
      <code>
        GET odt_jeymart_items/_search <br/>
        { <br/>
          <sp/>"size": 16, <br/>
          <sp/>"query": { <br/>
            <sp/><sp/>"bool": { <br/>
              <sp/><sp/><sp/>"must": [ <br/>
                <sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/>{ <br/>
                  <sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/>"match": { <br/>
                    <sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/>"t_description": "cake" <br/>
                  <sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/>} <br/>
                <sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/>}, <br/>
                <sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/>{ <br/>
                  <sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/>"match": { <br/>
                    <sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/>"k_category": "food" <br/>
                  <sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/>} <br/>
                <sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/>}, <br/>
                <sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/>{ <br/>
                  <sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/>"match": { <br/>
                    <sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/>"s_brand_name": "avery works" <br/>
                  <sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/>} <br/>
                <sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/>} <br/>
              <sp/><sp/><sp/>] <br/>
            <sp/><sp/>} <br/>
          <sp/>} <br/>
        }
      </code>
    </div>
    You can see that we no longer use a single and simple <mark>Match Query</mark>
    to get all these 3 criteria satisfied. Instead, we use a new query named
    <mark>Boolean Query</mark>; for our use case all we need is to use the <var>MUST</var>
    clause to combine the 3 MANDATORY criteria
    (i.e. searchbar text, category chosen and brand chosen). The other clauses
    available are <var>MUST NOT</var>, <var>SHOULD</var> and <var>FILTER</var>.
  </div>


  <div class='sf-chapter-sub-label'>pagination</div>
  <div class='sf-paragraph-sub text-justify' style="overflow: auto;">
    When you have a lot of results to display, it would be wise to provide
    pagination capabilities instead of loading all results on 1 page at the
    very beginning. In <mark>Elasticsearch</mark>, basic pagination is
    easy to implement. Let's take a look at the code snippet below:
    <p/>
    <img src='/image/spy/landingListSpy02.png'
      style='width: 400px; margin-right: 4px; border: 1px solid #ddd;' />
    <img src='/image/spy/landingListSpy03.png'
      style='width: 400px; margin-right: 4px; border: 1px solid #ddd;' />
    <p style="margin-top: 8px;"/>
    You can see that all we need to do is to add back the <var>from</var>
    parameter and set it to the correct index, then we could <mark>"page"</mark> around
    the results. Brilliant!

    Cool! In this section, we have covered and run through
    <mark><a href='https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-bool-query.html'
      target="_blank">Boolean Query</a></mark> and

      target="_blank">Pagination concepts</a></mark>.
    <p style="margin-top: 8px;"/>
    By now, you have experienced how to write a complex query with multiple
    matching criteria by using a <mark>Boolean Query</mark> and also how to
    provide <mark>pagination</mark> capability to a large result set. For
    the next section, we would look into other kinds of <mark>"suggestions"</mark>
    based on the selected product item.
