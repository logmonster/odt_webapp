  Advance Search Panel
</h1>

<div class='sf-parargraph'>
  In this section, we will cover the following search queries:
  <ul class="sf-list">
    <li><mark>Match Query</mark> and its variances - basic search based on term(s)</li>
    <li><mark>Match Phrase Query</mark> and its variances - treat the terms as a phrase</li>
    <li><mark>Multi Match Query</mark> - matching multiple fields for a term</li>
    <li><mark>Terms Query</mark> - matching multiple terms in a field</li>
  </ul>

  <div class='sf-chapter-sub-label'>Match Query</div>
  <div class='sf-paragraph-sub text-justify'>
    The simplest and yet flexible query to perform basic searches. By default the
    <var>"operator"</var> for a MatchQuery is <mark>"OR"</mark>; which means that any
    document with the given field's value matches ANY of the terms would be a match.
  </div>
  <div class='sf-paragraph-sub text-justify' style="overflow: auto;">
    <img src='/image/spy/advSpy00.png'
      style='width: 400px; float: left; margin-right: 4px; border: 1px solid #ddd;' />
    If you type <mark>"necklace green"</mark> in the search-term textbox and
    set the size of the query batch to <mark>"20"</mark>; you would get back a list
    of results related to either <mark>green</mark> OR <mark>necklace</mark>.
    For the first few results in the list; they seem to be quite relevant (e.g.
    DIAMANTE NECKLACE GREEN, GREEN MURANO TWIST NECKLACE), however if you keep on
    scrolling down the list, you would find that the results are less and less
    related to "necklace green" (e.g. GREEN SWEETHEART BRACELET, GREEN VINTAGE EARRINGS).
    The reason is because the default <var>operator</var> for MatchQuery is <mark>OR</mark>.
  </div>
  <div class='sf-paragraph-sub text-justify'>
    Now, let's modify the <var>operator</var> to <mark>"AND"</mark> instead. Run
    the query again and now every result returned <mark>MUST</mark> have both "necklace"
    and "green" available in the given field (in this case, "t_description"). This
    is a simple technique to restrict the number of results returned and also at
    the same time increase accuracy (return more relevant results).
  </div>
  <div class='sf-paragraph-sub text-justify'>
    If you don't want to be so restrictive in retrieving the results, you can
    keep using <var>operator</var> = <mark>OR</mark>, and configure the
    <var>minimum should match</var> setting instead. Assume you typed in
    <mark>"green earring necklace"</mark> and set the minimum should match
    setting to <mark>2</mark>. Run the query and you should get back a list of
    results having 2 or more of the terms matched in the designated field
    (in this case "t_description"). For the first few results, you got back
    "GREEN VINTAGE EARRINGS" (which matches 2 terms - green and earring),
    "DIAMANTE NECKLACE GREEN" (which matches 2 terms - green and necklace).
    By now, you have added flexibility in retreiving a match (using OR) and at
    the same restricting the number of entries returned based on
    accuracy / relevancy (minimum should match).
  </div>
  <div class='sf-paragraph-sub text-justify' style="overflow: auto;">
    <img src='/image/spy/advSpy01.png'
      style='width: 400px; float: left; margin-right: 4px; border: 1px solid #ddd;' />
    The last option available in the panel area is "highlight"; this is a
    handy option for helping you to spot out why a document is a match with the
    given terms and settings (e.g. operator change). If we turn on "highlight";
    the matched terms would be in <span style="color: #f00;">red</span> color.
    Giving you a hint why and where this document is a match. Try to turn the
    "highlight" off and run the query again. Now there would be no hint at all
    for the results.
  </div>
  <div class='sf-paragraph-sub text-justify'>
    The <mark>"Query DSL"</mark> panel shows you exactly how the query DSL is
    created and to be run against your Elasticsearch instance. Try to change
    the settings and run the query, you will notice the query inside the panel
    would change accordingly.
  </div>
</div>

<div class='sf-chapter-sub-label'>Match Phrase Query</div>
<div class='sf-paragraph-sub text-justify'>
  If you want a more restrictive way to retrieve documents
  (not just all the terms are within that field of the document), such as the
  position of terms <mark>MUST</mark> be in sequence.
  <mark>Match Phrase Query</mark> can help.
</div>
<div class='sf-paragraph-sub text-justify' style="overflow: auto;">
  <img src='/image/spy/advSpy02.png'
    style='width: 400px; float: left; margin-right: 4px; border: 1px solid #ddd;' />
  Type in <mark>"vintage earring green"</mark> as the search text and run the
  query. Now you would have ZERO results, why? The reason is a hit means the
  document's t_description field needs to have <mark>vintage</mark>,
  <mark>green</mark> and <mark>earring</mark> to be available
  <span style="color: #f00;">PLUS</span> the ordering of the 3 terms must in
  the given sequence as well. Hence no results returned. Modify the search text
  into <mark>"green vintage earring"</mark> and run the query again. This time
  you would get back 2 results, do focus on the <span style="color: #f00;">highlighted</span>
  t_description field and you would find out that both results have the terms
  in the exactly sequence we provided.
  <p style="margin-top: 8px;"/>
  Having such restrictive rules is good for certain use cases, however, wouldn't
  it be even better if we could add certain flexibility? The <var>slop</var>
  operator let's us add a configured number of arbitrary term(s) in between our
  phrase. Type in <mark>"green earring"</mark> in the search text and run the query.
  Zero results returned as there are no such document with t_description having
  exactly "green earring" as the value. Now modify the <var>slop</var> operator,
  set it to <mark>1</mark> and run the query again. Now you should get back 6
  results and take a look at the <span style="color: #f00;">highlighted</span>
  t_description, you can see that there is exactly "1" arbitrary term
  between "green" and "earring". We successfully setup our restritive query
  condition and adding a certain degree of flexibility.
</div>


<div class='sf-chapter-sub-label'>Multi Match Query</div>
<div class='sf-paragraph-sub text-justify'>
  There are times when you would want to search a given term(s) across multiple
  fields. For example, our Jey-mart eCommerce store, the searchbar might actually
  search the given search text across both "t_description" and "s_brand_name"
  fields.
</div>
<div class='sf-paragraph-sub text-justify'>
  Type in <mark>"design"</mark> as the search text and run the query. You should
  get back a list of results. The 1st result shows that there is a match with
  <mark>design</mark> at both <mark>t_description</mark> and <mark>s_brand_name</mark> field.
  In real world use cases, you might want to search certain products name across
  "user_comments" and "shopping_list" fields, so now you would be able to know
  for a certain product, how many user comments on it
  (also is the comment positive or negative) plus how well does it sell
  (based on age group, gender etc);
  more importantly, you could derive a set of metrics, visualizations and dashboards
  based on these findings which might help you to predict a sales trend!
</div>


<div class='sf-chapter-sub-label'>Terms Query</div>
<div class='sf-paragraph-sub text-justify' style="overflow: auto;">
  <img src='/image/spy/advSpy03.png'
    style='width: 400px; float: left; margin-right: 4px; border: 1px solid #ddd;' />
  Slightly different from Multi-Search query, you might want to search a list of
  terms on a single field. For example, you might want to retrieve documents
  containing "sports shoes" and "sneakers" for the "product_description" field;
  in such case, you know that sports-shoes are equivalent to sneakers in some sense,
  hence searching both terms might benefit you most.
  <p style="margin-top: 8px;"/>
  Type in <mark>cake,design</mark> as the search text and run the query. Now you
  should get back a list of results containing either <mark>"cake"</mark> or <mark>"design"</mark>
  as a hit.
</div>
