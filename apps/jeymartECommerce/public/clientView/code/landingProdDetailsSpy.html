  In this section, we will cover the following topics:
  <ul class="sf-list">
    <li>the introduction of the areas / components of the shop product details page</li>
    <li>suggestions based on <mark>More Like This Query</mark></li>
    <li>suggestions based on <mark>Significant Terms Aggregation</mark></li>
  </ul>

  <div class='sf-chapter-sub-label'>the Shop Product Details page</div>
  <div class='sf-paragraph-sub text-justify' style="overflow: auto;">
    <img src='/image/spy/landingProdDetailsSpy00.png'
      style='width: 400px; float: left; margin-right: 4px; border: 1px solid #ddd;' />

    The product details page consists of several areas / components of interest.
    At the top, the <mark>searchbar</mark> component
    (once hit the magnifying glass icon would forward back to the shop listing page),
    the <mark>filters</mark> area showing what category or brand has been chosen,
    the <mark>back button</mark> which forwards back to the shop listing page.
    <p style="margin-top: 8px;"/>
    Then the top part of the page consists of the product item details card component
    as well as the <mark>comments</mark> component (the comments are hard-coded
    at the moment, again the course focuses on how to integrate
    <mark>Elasticsearch</mark> with the view technology stack, hence all the
    components are coded as simple as possible. In real world situations, the
    comments information should be stored in another index and ready to be
    retrieved by a query). For the moment of time, the product item details card
    component has no real functionality; in real world situations, clicking the
    card could trigger an <mark>"add to cart"</mark> operation.
    <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    <p style="margin-top: 8px;"/>
    The lower part of the page consists of 2 <mark>suggestion areas</mark>; each area provides
    a list of suggestions based on different approaches namely
    <var>More Like This</var> and <var>Significant Terms</var> suggestions.
  </div>


  <div class='sf-chapter-sub-label'>More Like This suggestion</div>
  <div class='sf-paragraph-sub text-justify'>
    Let's start with the <mark>More Like This</mark> suggestion. From
    <mark>Elasticsearch</mark>'s documentation:
    <blockquote class="blockquote text-left">
      <p class="mb-0">
        The <mark>More Like This Query</mark> finds documents that are
        <var>"like"</var> a given set of documents. In order to do so,
        MLT selects a set of <mark>representative terms</mark> of
        these input documents, forms a query using these terms,
        executes the query and returns the results.
        The user controls the input documents, how the terms should be
        selected and how the query is formed.
      </p>
      <a href='https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-mlt-query.html'
        target="_blank">
        https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-mlt-query.html
      </a>
    </blockquote>
    You can see that this approach is a <mark>Query</mark> and trying to match
    documents that are "like" in some ways. In our use case, we would provide
    a document's meta data to act as a cue for the <mark>More Like This Query</mark>
    to execute against. The code snippet as follows:
  </div>

  <div class='sf-paragraph-sub text-justify' >
    <div>
      <code>
GET odt_jeymart_items/_search <br />
{ <br />
  <sp/>"query": { <br />
    <sp/><sp/>"more_like_this": { <br />
      <sp/><sp/><sp/>"fields": [ <br />
        <sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/>"t_description" <br />
      <sp/><sp/><sp/>], <br />
      <sp/><sp/><sp/>"like": { <br />
        <sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/>"_index": "odt_jeymart_items", <br />
        <sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/>"_type": "doc", <br />
        <sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/>"_id": "AVylX6bzdr2sb8BuSRoG" <br />
      <sp/><sp/><sp/>}, <br />
      <sp/><sp/><sp/>"min_term_freq": 1 <br />
    <sp/><sp/>} <br />
  <sp/>} <br />
}
      </code>
    </div>
    As mentioned, we would provide a document's meta data; in this case, we
    provide the <var>index</var>, <var>document_type</var> and <var>document_id</var>
    information for the query to execute against. All these meta information
    is available per document you retrieved earlier. (remember that <mark>Elasticsearch</mark>
    always return you the meta data along with the <var>_source</var> data).
    We also specify which field is to be referenced, in this case <mark>t_description</mark>.
    <p style="margin-top: 8px;"/>
    If everything's right, we would be able to get back a list of suggestions. Cool!
  </div>


  <div class='sf-chapter-sub-label'>Significant Terms suggestion</div>
  <div class='sf-paragraph-sub text-justify'>
    Next, we look into another way to provide suggestions. This time we are
    going to use <mark>aggregations</mark> - <var>Significant Terms</var>. From
    <mark>Elasticsearch</mark>'s documentation:
    <blockquote class="blockquote text-left">
      <p class="mb-0">
        An aggregation that returns <var>interesting</var> or <var>unusual</var>
        occurrences of terms in a set.
        <br/>...<br/>
        In all these cases the terms being selected are
        <var>not simply the most popular terms</var> in a set.
        They are the terms that have undergone a
        <var>significant change in popularity</var> measured between a
        <mark>foreground</mark> and <mark>background</mark> set.
        If the term "H5N1" only exists in 5 documents in a 10 million
        document index and yet is found in 4 of the 100 documents that make up
        a userâ€™s search results that is significant and probably very relevant
        to their search. 5/10,000,000 vs 4/100 is a big swing in frequency.
      </p>

    Make it simple, <mark>significant terms</mark> aggregation helps to find
    out unusual terms within a document set / context. We are not just
    focusing on the popularity but instead of the unusual terms that are
    interested for that document set / context. The following is the code
    snippet:
  </div>

  <div class='sf-paragraph-sub text-justify' >
    <div>
      <code>
GET odt_jeymart_items/_search <br/>
{ <br/>

  <sp/>"query": { <br/>

      <sp/><sp/><sp/>"must": [ <br/>
        <sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/>{ <br/>

            <sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/>"t_description": "folkart heart napkin rings" <br/>

      <sp/><sp/><sp/>}, <br/>
      <sp/><sp/><sp/>"aggs": { <br/>

              <sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/>"t_description" <br/>
            <sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/>], <br/>
            <sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/>"size": 2 <br/>
          <sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/>} <br/>
        <sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/>} <br/>
      <sp/><sp/><sp/>} <br/>
    <sp/><sp/>} <br/>
  <sp/>} <br/>
}
      </code>
    </div>
    Let's dissect the complex query part by part. The 1st part of the query is a
    <mark>Boolean Query</mark> combining the criteria for document retrieval (
    searchbar text, facets of category and / or brand chosen); the 2nd part is
    the aggregation.
    <p style="margin-top: 8px;"/>
    We start to create a bucket aggregation based on <mark>Significant Terms</mark>,
    the field for bucketing is <mark>s_brand_name.keyword</mark> this gives
    <mark>Elasticsearch</mark> a cue on how to build the buckets for us.
    Make it simple, the context in which we want to get back some suggestions this
    time is based on the "brand name".
    Then we added a nested aggregation, <mark>top hits</mark>,
    which returns the top documents (in this case, size of 2) that composite
    its corresponding bucket.
    <p style="margin-top: 8px;"/>
    Nice! Now we should be able to get back Significant Terms suggestions as well.
    The rest is just how we display these information back to the client.
  </div>


  <div class='sf-chapter-sub-label'>Summary</div>
  <div class='sf-paragraph-sub text-justify'>
    Cool! In this section, we have covered and run through
    <mark><a href='https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-mlt-query.html'
      target="_blank">More Like This Query</a></mark> and
    <mark><a href='https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket-significantterms-aggregation.html'
      target="_blank">Significant Terms Aggregation</a></mark>.
    <p style="margin-top: 8px;"/>
    By now, you should have ideas on how to provide suggestions based on a
    given document either using <mark>More Like This Query</mark> or
    <mark>Significant Terms Aggregation</mark>. Of course, you can also
    run Regex Query to match a field's value against a regular expression
    denoting your search terms. There are many other approaches to provide
    suggestions and there is no the <mark>BEST</mark> approach, so
    explore a little bit and pick the one that suits your business use case MOST.
