    Jey-mart is an imaginary eCommerce store selling all sorts of products
    ranging from clothings (fashion category) to biscuits (food category).
    Basically there are 3 areas / components on the landing page namely:<p/>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>1. searchbar</li>
        <li>2. facets area</li>
        <li>3. listing top 4 area</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    Each of the above areas / components' features and implementation would be
    explained in their own sections.
    <p style="margin-top: 8px;"/>
    PS. The data involved for the app is completely created from scratch
    (using simple random algorithms to generate the contents) and hence,
    some data might look strange <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>.
    <p style="margin-top: 8px;"/>
    PS. The view technology stack chosen for the app is
    <mark><a href='https://vuejs.org/' target="_blank">Vue.js</a></mark>.
    Vue is chosen by its simplicity and capabilities (would say Vue has the
    merits of
    <mark><a href='https://angular.io/' target="_blank">Ng4</a></mark> -
    client side application architecture and
    <mark><a href='https://reactjs.org/' target="_blank">react.js</a></mark> -
    component awared development).
    In this course, we would focus on how to integrate
    <mark>Elasticsearch's</mark> queries and aggregations with the
    view stack technology (could be any framework rather than Vue.js), hence
    the techniques or approaches of the view side would be skipped. But do feel
    free to look into the client side code on how the components are created

  <div class='sf-chapter-sub-label'>Searchbar and auto-completion</div>
  <div class='sf-paragraph-sub text-justify' style="overflow: auto;">
    <img src='/image/spy/landingInfoSpy03.png'
      style='width: 180px; float: left; margin-right: 4px; border: 1px solid #ddd;' />

    Searchbar component consists of 1 aggregation and 1 query. The "categories"
    list is retreived through an <mark>aggregation</mark> (Terms aggregation),
    whilst the auto-completion feature is provided by running a
    <mark>suggestion query</mark> whenever the contents inside the
    searchbar textbox has changed.
    <p style="margin-top: 8px;"/>
    Let's start with the "categories" aggregation. As explained in earlier
    chapters of the course, aggregation returns statistical values from
    buckets of data (default stats is <mark>"count"</mark> of documents).
    Terms aggregation creates buckets based on the textual values of a
    given field within an index; in this case we are going to use
    <var>"k_category"</var> field from the <var>"odt_jeymart_items"</var>
    index. The aggregation is as follows:
  </div>

  <div class='sf-paragraph-sub text-justify' >
    <div>
      <code>
        GET jeymart_item/_search <br/>
        { <br/>
          <space />"size": 0, <br/>
          <space />"aggs": { <br/>
            <space /><space />"_cats": { <br/>
              <space /><space /><space />"terms": { <br/>
                <space /><space /><space /><space />"field": "k_category", <br/>
                <space /><space /><space /><space />"size": 20, <br/>
                <space /><space /><space /><space />"order": { <br/>
                  <space /><space /><space /><space /><space />"_key": "asc" <br/>
                <space /><space /><space /><space />} <br/>
              <space /><space /><space />} <br/>
            <space /><space />} <br/>
          <space />} <br/>
        }
      </code>
    </div>
    Now we get back the list of categories for the searchbar component. Do note
    that we have an "order" clause for sorting on the aggregation buckets;
    in this case we simply sort by the textual values of the buckets instead of
    by count - use <var>_key</var> to refer to the textual value.
    <p style="margin-top: 8px;"/>
    Next, we are going to take a look on how the "suggestion" query would
    look like.
  </div>

  <div class='sf-paragraph-sub text-justify' >
    <div>
      <code>
        GET odt_jeymart_items/_search<br/>
        {<br/>
          <space />"suggest": {<br/>
            <space /><space />"_suggestions": {<br/>
              <space /><space /><space />"prefix": "pea",<br/>
              <space /><space /><space />"completion": {<br/>
                <space /><space /><space /><space />"field": "t_description.suggest"<br/>
              <space /><space /><space />}<br/>
            <space /><space />}<br/>
          <space />}<br/>
        }
      </code>
    </div>
    You can see a "suggestion" is a kind of query as well, the <var>prefix</var>
    parameter is the text typed in by the user and we are using this text to
    act as the "prefix" of our auto-completion suggestions. <var>completion.field</var>
    tells Elasticsearch which field we are going to check for the suggestions.
    For more information about the index level mappings for the completion field,
    please read <mark>"chapter 4 - case study, eCommerce website"</mark>.
  </div>


  <div class='sf-chapter-sub-label'>Facets</div>
  <div class='sf-paragraph-sub text-justify'>
    What is "facets"? According to Wikipedia:
    <blockquote class="blockquote text-left">
      <p class="mb-0">
        Faceted search, also called faceted navigation or faceted browsing,
        is a technique for accessing information organized according to a
        faceted classification system, allowing users to
        <mark>explore a collection of information</mark> by applying
        <mark>multiple filters</mark>. A faceted classification system
        classifies each information element along multiple explicit dimensions,
        called facets, enabling the classifications to be accessed
        and ordered in multiple ways rather than in a single, pre-determined, taxonomic order.
      </p>
      <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faceted_search' target="_blank">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faceted_search
      </a>
    </blockquote>
    So make it simple, facets provides us different ways to interprete the
    data set we have. In Jey-mart, we provide 2 facets information namely
    <mark>"categories"</mark> and <mark>"brands"</mark>. So why is facets
    important to the eCommerce website? The 1st thing is you don't need to
    search for anything beforehand and some basic statistical values are
    already available for you (in our case, the <mark>"count"</mark> of
    documents within the category or brand are always available). By then, if
    you changed the searching criteria for the search, the corresponding facets
    information (count in this case) should also be updated as well; this is
    again very informational as you now know exactly how many products a certain
    brand has a match with your search criteria (update on the fly).
    <p style="margin-top: 8px;"/>
    As you could guess, the facets are again <mark>aggregations</mark> and in this
    case we are using the <mark>"count"</mark> metric. Example on the "brand"
    facets as follows:
  </div>

  <div class='sf-paragraph-sub text-justify' >
    <div>
      <code>
        GET odt_jeymart_items/_search <br/>
        { <br/>
          <space/>"size": 0, <br/>
          <space/>"aggs": { <br/>
            <space/><space/>"_cats": { <br/>
              <space/><space/><space/>"terms": { <br/>
                <space/><space/><space/><space/>"field": "s_brand_name.keyword", <br/>
                <space/><space/><space/><space/>"size": 20, <br/>
                <space/><space/><space/><space/>"order": { <br/>
                  <space/><space/><space/><space/><space/>"_count": "desc" <br/>
                <space/><space/><space/><space/>} <br/>
              <space/><space/><space/>} <br/>
            <space/><space/>} <br/>
          <space/>} <br/>
        }
      </code>
    </div>
    1 important point to note about Terms aggregation is that only
    <mark>"exact values"</mark> could be aggregated; that's why we are using
    <var>"s_brand_name.keyword"</var> as the field. The reason is simple, if
    we are using a <mark>text-analyzed</mark> field, which means all the contents within this
    field has been lowercased or even stemmed, there is no way for us to
    evaluate and compare if the values from document 1 and document 2 are
    actually referring to the same values. Hence to make our life easier,
    we can only use <mark>NON text-analyzed</mark> fields to do the aggregation.

  </div>


  <div class='sf-chapter-sub-label'>Top Hits aggregation</div>
  <div class='sf-paragraph-sub text-justify'>
    If you still remember for most aggregations, only a statistical value would
    be returned per bucket. There are cases when we need to get back the actual
    documents composited this bucket; with this intention, we need to know
    the <mark>"top hits"</mark> aggregation.
  </div>

    The aggregation this time is much more complex than we had seen before. We
    have created 1 level of bucket and 2 metrics; we started by
    creating the 1st level of bucket based on the categories (<var>k_category</var>)
    and we are targeting 5 categories only. Then we create the 1st metric based
    on the <mark>sum</mark> of the quantities (<var>i_qty</var>) sold, the
    metric value is re-used as the sorting criteria for the <var>k_category</var>
    buckets (remember we are targeting the top 5 categories based
    on the value of each buckets' sum of quantities sold). Finally, we create
    the <var>"top hits"</var> metrics so that we could get back the top 4 documents
    compositing its corresponding bucket.

    Interesting! In the RDBMS world, we perform all these things in "searches",
    but when using <mark>Elasticsearch</mark> we actually used a lot of
    aggregations too (even though aggregations and suggestions are also a
    kind of query / search). In the next section, we are going to look into
    the query(s) for Jey-mart eCommerce website.
