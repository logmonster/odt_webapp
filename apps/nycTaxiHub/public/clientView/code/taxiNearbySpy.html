  In this section, we will cover the following topics:
  <ul class="sf-list">
    <li>the introduction of the areas / components of the NYC Taxi Hub app</li>
    <li>the query result based on the location chosen and its distance in miles or km</li>
  </ul>

  <div class='sf-chapter-sub-label'>the NYC Taxi Hub app and its components</div>
  <div class='sf-paragraph-sub text-justify' style="overflow: auto;">
    <img src='/image/spy/nearby00.png'
      class="pointer"
      onclick="window.open('/image/spy/nearby00.png', '_blank');"
      style='width: 400px; float: left; margin-right: 4px; border: 1px solid #ddd;' />
    the NYC Taxi Hub app is built to illustrate the power of <var>Elasticsearch's</var>
    <mark>GEOLOCATION</mark> capabilities; as well as how it could integrate with 3rd party
    <var>MAP</var> libraries such as
    <var>Google Map</var>&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-copyright" aria-hidden="true"></i>.
    One important point to note is that the dataset is based on the
    <a href='http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/passenger/passenger.shtml' target="_blank">NYC taxi</a>
    information; hence if you are providing a GeoPoint outside NYC, you won't
    be able to see any search result return.
    <p style="margin-top: 8px;"/>
    PS. The view technology stack chosen for the app is
    <mark><a href='https://vuejs.org/' target="_blank">Vue.js</a></mark>.
    Vue is chosen by its simplicity and capabilities (would say Vue has the
    merits of
    <mark><a href='https://angular.io/' target="_blank">Ng4</a></mark> -
    client side application architecture and
    <mark><a href='https://reactjs.org/' target="_blank">react.js</a></mark> -
    component awared development).
    In this course, we would focus on how to integrate
    <mark>Elasticsearch's</mark> queries and aggregations with the
    view stack technology (could be any framework rather than Vue.js), hence
    the techniques or approaches of the view side would be skipped. But do feel
    free to look into the client side code on how the components are created
    <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>.

  <div class='sf-chapter-sub-label'>"Set my Location" component</div>
  <div class='sf-paragraph-sub text-justify' style="overflow: auto;">
    this component's main goal is to let you key in a valid <var>GeoPoint</var>
    to set the <mark>center marker</mark> on the Map. Another way to set
    the GeoPoint (the latitude and longitude pair) is by entering a place name;
    this place name is used to retrieve the corresponding GeoPoint by the
    <var>Google Maps Geocoding API</var>.
    <p style="margin-top: 8px;"/>
    PS. there are cases that the place name given might not be recognizable OR
    it could be recognized as another place instead.
    <p style="margin-top: 8px;"/>
    PS. since this course is based on how to integrate Elasticsearch Geo
    capabilities with the View stack technology; details on how to invoke
    Google Maps API are skipped; but do feel free to read the code on how to
    drive Google Maps to work. <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </div>

  <div class='sf-chapter-sub-label'>"Nearby Taxi" component</div>
  <div class='sf-paragraph-sub text-justify' style="overflow: auto;">
    by providing the <var>distance</var> in either <mark>miles</mark> OR
    <mark>km</mark>; we could get back all the taxi(s) within the
    given distance originating from the center marker indicated by the
    "Set my Location" component.
    <p style="margin-top: 8px;"/>
    We are using the <mark>geo-distance</mark> query to get back the results:
  </div>

  <div class='sf-paragraph-sub text-justify' >
    <div>
      <code>
        GET nyc_taxi_hub_2016_11/_search <br/>
        { <br/>
          <sp/>"size": 1000, <br/>
          <sp/>"query": { <br/>
            <sp/><sp/>"bool": { <br/>
              <sp/><sp/><sp/>"filter": [ <br/>
                <sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/>{ <br/>
                  <sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/>"geo_distance": { <br/>
                    <sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/>"distance": "2miles", <br/>
                    <sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/>"pickup_location.location": { <br/>
                      <sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/>"lon": -73.96535510000001, <br/>
                      <sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/>"lat": 40.7828647 <br/>
                    <sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/>} <br/>
                  <sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/>} <br/>
                <sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/>} <br/>
              <sp/><sp/><sp/>] <br/>
            <sp/><sp/>} <br/>
          <sp/>} <br/>
        } <br/>
      </code>
    </div>
    Now we get back the 1st 1000 documents (taxis) based on the GeoPoint of
    the provided center marker. The field we use to calculate the distance is
    based on <var>pickup_location.location</var> which is a
    <mark>geo_point</mark> data-type.

  <div class='sf-chapter-sub-label'>Summary</div>
  <div class='sf-paragraph-sub text-justify'>
    Cool! In this section, we have covered and run through
    <mark><a href='https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-geo-distance-query.html'
      target="_blank">Geo-distance Query</a></mark>.
    <p style="margin-top: 8px;"/>
    By now, you have an idea how Geo-distance works! In real world use cases,
    shared-economy transportation apps use similar geolocation technologies to
    locate vehicles (automobiles, taxis or vans) for services. Basically, the
    vehicles would update their geo-locatin through GPS; take an example, if
    you are trying to call a vehicle (could be a taxi) at NYC Times Square, the
    app would use Times Square's latitude and longitude pair as the origin and
    starts to find the available vehicles within a certain distance (e.g. 2 miles).
    Theoretically, the vehicles should be sorted or scored base on how near
    they are to the origin point.
    <p style="margin-top: 8px;"/>
    There are so many applications that also make use of Geolocations technology;
    dating apps and chat-based apps also have geo-distance features like
    "find a person nearby". Typically if your business or app could collect
    geolocation information, there might be a chance to add new services / features
    based on geo-distance(s).
