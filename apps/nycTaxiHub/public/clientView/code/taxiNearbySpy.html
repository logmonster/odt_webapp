  In this section, we will cover the following topics:
  <ul class="sf-list">
    <li>the introduction of the areas / components of the NYC Taxi Hub app</li>
    <li>the query result based on the location chosen and its distance in miles or km</li>
  </ul>

  <div class='sf-chapter-sub-label'>the NYC Taxi Hub app and its components</div>
  <div class='sf-paragraph-sub text-justify'>
    the NYC Taxi Hub app is built to illustrate the power of <var>Elasticsearch's</var>
    <mark>GEOLOCATION</mark> capabilities; as well as how it could integrate with 3rd party
    <var>MAP</var> libraries such as
    <var>Google Map</var>&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-copyright" aria-hidden="true"></i>.
    <p style="margin-top: 8px;"/>
    PS. The view technology stack chosen for the app is
    <mark><a href='https://vuejs.org/' target="_blank">Vue.js</a></mark>.
    Vue is chosen by its simplicity and capabilities (would say Vue has the
    merits of
    <mark><a href='https://angular.io/' target="_blank">Ng4</a></mark> -
    client side application architecture and
    <mark><a href='https://reactjs.org/' target="_blank">react.js</a></mark> -
    component awared development).
    In this course, we would focus on how to integrate
    <mark>Elasticsearch's</mark> queries and aggregations with the
    view stack technology (could be any framework rather than Vue.js), hence
    the techniques or approaches of the view side would be skipped. But do feel
    free to look into the client side code on how the components are created
